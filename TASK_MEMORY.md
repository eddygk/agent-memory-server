# Task Memory

**Created:** 2025-06-13 16:26:51
**Branch:** feature/write-a-new

## Requirements

Write a new CHANGELOG.md file. Include two versions: 0.0.1, whose description says basically, 'Initial release: basic short-term and long-term memory.' Then 0.9.0, which should act like a diff between that initial release and the latest set of features. It doesn't have to be perfect: mention stabilized APIs and concepts, with 'short-term' memory changing to 'working memory.' Detail the ability of clients to use working and long-term memory as tools (for the LLM) with the client SDK. Detail the availability of a REST and MCP API. Explain the new flow of memory into working memory that is then moved in the background to long-term memory. Detail the ability of working memory to contain arbitrary JSON data in addition to the memory structure. And anythin gelse interesting from the docs.
